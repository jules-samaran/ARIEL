# ARIEL

This project was conducted on their free time by two students from Mines Paristech, Jules Samaran and Timothée Launay. The objective was to create an algorithm which takes as input an image and draws a sketch as close as possible to the input image. We chose to restrict the drawing technique to black straight lines drawn iteratively so that the algorithm's behaviour would resemble an artist's attempt to draw a preliminary sketch. In the "Technical description" section you can read how we achieved this goal.

## Getting started

### Installing

Start by cloning this repository and in the directory where you downloaded the project run this command in your Linux terminal:
'''
pip install -r requirements.txt
'''
or simply install manually every python package listed in the requirements.txt file.

### Using ARIEL

Take a look at "Demo_notebook.ipynb" which will show what the algorithm can do and will enable you to realize sketches of any image.
